5 dream reports to practice on

5.1.1 Dream example 1

A kind of war in Germany. Some friends who also do sports with me and were in the Bundeswehr sports sponsorship and I practiced tank shooting at strange targets. "Generals" in the war was a well-known trainer and his "generals" who led the troops were two other athletes. The evening before I saw a report about contradictions about September 11th. They were both very complex dreams and unfortunately I can't remember everything. In both dreams, I was neither afraid nor negative feelings.

5.1.2 Dream example 2

Talked on the phone before going to bed with a friend who also does a lot of sports, talked to us about the current situation, which is rather difficult. More difficult for me because of injury than for him.

dreamed of a surreal forest area in which I had to win a race on foot against cars and other things and that of other athletes I know. Some coaches become some sort of referee or visitor or spectator. In the dream I had the feeling that I had to win, I felt rushed and driven to be even faster. Amazingly, despite the overwhelming power of the motorized competitors, I am not overtaken. The terrain was difficult with bizarre trees and roots. I felt like a deer is after a pack of dogs. I don't know if I won and I was in a really good mood this morning. In retrospect and thinking about this dream, I could interpret most of the elements of the dream (right or wrong) myself. For me the content is quite understandable.

5.1.3 Dream example 3

In the dream it was somehow again about malaria. I have already been to a malaria area, but this and the last two dreams were not threatening or anything like that. I probably dreamed as a “researcher” and not as a patient. But unfortunately I can't remember anything more.
