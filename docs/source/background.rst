The dream report plays a central role in psychological dream research (`Schredl, 2018 <http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-95453-0>`_, especially Chapter 3). A subjective description of the dream is the only window available to the mentation that occurs during sleep. Dream reports are typically provided through written or recorded report, and there are rare instances of dreams reported via drawings (e.g., `Leuschner et al., 1994 <https://doi.org/10.1037/h0094387>`_). Despite promising objective approaches to documenting dreams, such as using recorded brain activity to reconstruct the dream content (e.g., `Horikawa et al., 2013 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1234330>`_), such applications are still far away from large-scale implementation. Thus, we have to work with verbal dream reports (`Windt, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00708>`_).

The obvious question is, can we trust dream reports? See `Windt, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00708>`_ and `Rosen, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00514>`_ for alternate accounts.
