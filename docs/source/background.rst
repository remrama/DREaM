The dream report plays a central role in psychological dream research (`Schredl, 2018 <http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-95453-0>`_). As the only window into the psychological mentation that occurs during sleep, the dream report is the basis for dream content analysis. In most studies, participants provide the dream experience in writing. Before these written reports can be used for further dream content analysis, they must first be processed/cleaned. **The individual processing steps are described in this manual.**

The first step involves :doc:`entering the hand-written or voice-recorded reports <digitizing>` into a computer. Particular attention must be paid to linguistically incorrect reports (2.1), illegible passages (2.2) and comments (2.3). Then all contents of the report that have nothing to do with the actual dream content must be deleted (3). This can be necessary at the beginning (3.1), at the end (3.2) and within the report (3.3). However, it can also concern complete reports if they do not contain any dream content (3.4). Now it is also possible to speak of a dream report in the true sense of the word.

Another point can then be instructions for dream content analysis (4).

At the end of this manual there are some dream reports on practicing this instruction (5).
