Background
==========

Subjective dream reports are the most viable data for studying dream content (`Windt, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00708>`_). Despite being imperfect representations of mental activity during sleep (`Rosen, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00514>`_), dream reports serve as the basis for dream content analyses (`Schredl, 2010 <https://doi.org/10.11588/ijodr.2010.1.474>`_). Dream reports are typically provided through written or recorded report, and there are rare instances of dreams reported via drawings (e.g., `Leuschner et al., 1994 <https://doi.org/10.1037/h0094387>`_). Despite promising objective approaches to documenting dreams, such as using recorded brain activity to reconstruct the dream content (e.g., `Horikawa et al., 2013 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1234330>`_), such applications are still far away from large-scale implementation.

However, in addition to the desired dream content, dream reports often contain a large amount of non-dream content. Therefore, a critical pre-processing step before analyzing dream reports is to "clean" them up by removing all the non-dream content (see `Schredl, 2018 <http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-95453-0>`_ Chapter 3.3 for more details).

To clean up a large database of dreams, it's useful to use *annotation software*. With annotation software, we can highlight relevant portions of the dream report that we want to keep, and later convert the annotation to a csv file that has a new column with the "dream-only" dream report. The following section, and purpose of this manual, is to provide suggested guidelines for extracting/highlighting dream content within the dream report.
