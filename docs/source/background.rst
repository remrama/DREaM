The dream report plays a central role in psychological dream research (`Schredl, 2018 <https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319954523>`_, especially Chapter 3). Despite future possibilities (e.g., `Horikawa et al., 2013 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1234330>`_), a subjective dream report provided upon awakening is the only window available to the mentation that occurs during sleep. Thus, the dream report is the basis for studying dream content. Though dream experiences can be reported in drawings (e.g., `Leuschner et al., 1994 <https://doi.org/10.1037/h0094387>`_), in most studies the participant reports the dream experience in written/typed or recorded audio form. Before recorded or written reports can be used for further dream content analysis, they must first be digitized.

Once in typed digital form, the dream report is pre-processed (i.e., *cleaned*) before going on to formal analysis and results. **This manual describes the rules/guidelines for annotating dream reports.**

The obvious question is, can we trust dream reports? See `Windt, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00708>`_ and `Rosen, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00514>`_ for alternate accounts.

The first step involves entering the hand-written or voice-recorded reports into a computer. Particular attention must be paid to linguistically incorrect reports (2.1), illegible passages (2.2) and comments (2.3). Then all contents of the report that have nothing to do with the actual dream content must be deleted (3). This can be necessary at the beginning (3.1), at the end (3.2) and within the report (3.3). However, it can also concern complete reports if they do not contain any dream content (3.4). Now it is also possible to speak of a dream report in the true sense of the word.

Another point can then be instructions for dream content analysis (4).

At the end of this manual there are some dream reports on practicing this instruction (5).
