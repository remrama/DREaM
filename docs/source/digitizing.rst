Digitizing
##########

The first step in preparing reports on dream content for dream content analysis is to enter the written or audio record unchanged into a word processing program (e.g. word, word-perfect, etc.). The report is to be taken one on one. Incorrect reports are not corrected (2.1). Slight modifications are necessary if individual words or passages are illegible (2.2). Comments can be helpful at individual points (2.3).

.. note::

   Skip this if the dream reports are already digitized (as in most cases).

Illegible words or passages in the report

If words cannot be clearly read in a report, they must be identified. The word in question should be reconstructed as closely as possible. The reconstructed word is underlined and the phrase “illegible, attempted reconstruction” is placed in square brackets next to the word.
