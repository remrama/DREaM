======================================================

A dream report is the recollection of the dream, which may or may not include excess non-dream content. The goal of annotation is to highlight only the dream content of a dream report, where dream content is "any subjective experience during sleep" (`Siclari et al., 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30275-1>`_).

   <em>
   <p>Last night I had another work dream. <span class="nonlucid">I was serving tables at the restaurant I work at but couldn't keep up with all the customer demands</span> (this actually happened at work a few days ago). <span class="nonlucid">Eventually I got so frustrated that I quit on the spot! I felt so relieved</span>, then I woke up. I think I keep dreaming about work because it's been so stressful lately.</p>

This is a document containing a set of guidelines for annotating – or cleaning – dream reports. The goal is to separate out dream from non-dream content in dream reports. After a (very) brief :ref:`background <background>` on the topic, the guidelines are all on the main :ref:`annotation rules <annotations>` page.
