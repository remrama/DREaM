Dream report pre-processing
===========================

The dream report plays a central role in psychological dream research (`Schredl, 2018 <https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319954523>`_, Chapter 3). As the only window into the psychological mentation that occurs during sleep, the dream report is the basis for dream content analysis. Though dream experiences can be reported in drawings (e.g., ), in most studies the participant reports the dream experience in writing/typing or recorded audio. Before recorded or written reports can be used for further dream content analysis, they must first be digitized. Once in written digital form, the dream are submitted to pre-processing (i.e., cleaning) before going on for formal analysis. **The individual pre-processing steps are described in this manual.**
