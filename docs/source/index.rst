Dream Report Annotation Manual
==============================

Dream reports are the most viable data for studying dream content, despite being imperfect representations (`Windt, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00708>`_). In addition to the desired dream content, dream reports often contain a large amount of non-dream content. Therefore, a critical pre-processing step before analyzing dream reports is to "clean them up" by removing all the non-dream content. To do so, **we use annotation software to highlight the relevant portions of the dream report we want to keep**.

**This manual includes the guidelines for what and what not to highlight in a dream report. Ultimately, the goal is to highlight only text that refers to or describes mental activity that occured during sleep.** Read through the entire guide before beginning to annotate.

Before recorded or written reports can be used for further dream content analysis, they must first be digitized. **This manual is written with the assumption that dream reports are already digitized, and in most cases pulled from originally digital sources.**

This is **not a coding manual or scoring guide** (as in `Schredl, M. (2010). Dream content analysis: Basic principles. International Journal of Dream Research. <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Schredl/publication/47541051_Dream_content_analysis_Basic_principles/links/5687b01b08aebccc4e1522bb/Dream-content-analysis-Basic-principles.pdf>`_). There is no specific outcome for each dream report (e.g., how much emotional content). The purpose here is to *annotate* the dream reports such that those analyses can be performed later. This is a *pre-processing* step, akin to "cleaning" the dream report, rather than a processing step.
