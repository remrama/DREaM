======================================================

Consider that a **dream** is broadly defined as "any subjective experience during sleep" (`Siclari et al., 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30275-1>`_), yet a **dream report** is defined as "the recollection of mental activity which has occurred during sleep" (`Schredl, 2010 <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0074-7742(10)92007-2>`_). A dream report is the *recollection* of the dream, which may or may not include excess non-dream content.

The goal of annotation is to highlight *only the dream content* of a dream report.

   <em>
   <p>Last night I had another work dream. <span class="nonlucid">I was serving tables at the restaurant I work at but couldn't keep up with all the customer demands</span> (this actually happened at work a few days ago). <span class="nonlucid">Eventually I got so frustrated that I quit on the spot! I felt so relieved</span>, then I woke up. I think I keep dreaming about work because it's been so stressful lately.</p>

**This is** a document containing a set of guidelines for annotating – or cleaning – dream reports. The goal is to separate out dream from non-dream content in dream reports. After a (very) brief :ref:`background <background>` on the topic, the guidelines are all on the main :ref:`annotation rules <annotations>` page.

**This is not** a "dream content analysis" coding manual or scoring guide (as described in `Schredl, 2010 <https://doi.org/10.11588/ijodr.2010.1.474>`_). That is, this is not a process of rating the specific contents (e.g., quantifying emotional content). These are steps for disentangling dream from non-dream content in dream reports, which is a necessary step prior to such analyses. It's a *pre-processing* step, not a processing step.
