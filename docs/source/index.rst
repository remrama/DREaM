Dream Report Annotation Manual
==============================

Dream reports are the most viable data for studying dream content (`Windt, 2013 <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00708>`_). However, in addition to the desired dream content, dream reports often contain a large amount of non-dream content. A critical step of pre-processing dream reports before formal analysis is to clean them of non-dream content. **This manual has rules for doing so.**

The ultimate goal is to highlight any text that refers to dream content, and leave the rest unmarked. Dream content *in this context* refers to any mental activity that occured during sleep and description of such mental activity. Section X provides more detail and examples.

**This manual is written with the assumption that dream reports are already digitized, and in most cases pulled from originally digital sources.** Though dream experiences can be reported in drawings (e.g., `Leuschner et al., 1994 <https://doi.org/10.1037/h0094387>`_), in most studies the participant reports the dream experience in written/typed or recorded audio form. Before recorded or written reports can be used for further dream content analysis, they must first be digitized.

This is **not a coding manual or scoring guide**. There is no outcome for each dream report (e.g., how much emotional content in a dream). The purpose here is to *annotate* the dream reports such that those analyses can be performed later. This is a *pre-processing* step, not a processing step.

Read through the entire guide before beginning to annotate, and then use the Annotation Rule section as a reference.
