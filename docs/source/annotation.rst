Annotation rules
================

.. raw:: html

   <p>
   This section has the specific guidelines for what does and does not constitute dream content within a dream report. Examples are provided for each rule, with non-lucid dream content highlighted in <span class="nonlucid">this color</span> and lucid dream content highlighted in <span class="lucid">this color</span>. Please read through the entire guide carefully before annotating dream reports.
   </p>
   
This can and should be used as a reference while annotating dream reports.

.. warning::

   These are not hard-and-fast rules, and you'll find that there are many ambiguous cases. As a general rule, *don't overthink*, rely on intuition, and don't debate over a specific annotation for more than a half a minute.



Intro/outro excess
------------------

Intro statements such as "I dreamt that ..." are **not included in the report**. Outro statements such as "... and then I woke up" are **not included in the report**.

   <blockquote class="dream">

   <p>I dream that <span class="nonlucid">I am in a big city, I go to a lot of shops and lose...</span></p>

Notably, there are instances where a specific reference to the dream has to be preserved for coherent sentence structure. It can be left in this case.


.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">I dreamed of a working on a school project, I totally failed!</span></p>

   <p><span class="nonlucid">I dreamt of a ski tour with my father.</span></p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>


Sometimes, especially in internet dream reports, there is a lot of miscellaneous material leading the dream report. Often a user that posts many dream reports has a personal system where they might lead the dream report with ratings and such, or a specific date or wakeup information. While this information might be interesting, it does not pertain to the dream experience *per se* and should not be included. There is sometimes similar content at the end of the report, which should of course also be exclued.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>NONLUCID - Galantamine 8mg - Sun morning 10:30 AM <span class="nonlucid">The dream started in my old high school and I was with most of my family. I couldn't stop thinking about how we shouldn't be there, in the school, but I don't know why. At the time there was nothing obvious to be afraid of.</span> UPDATED: 10/20/2015</p>

   </blockquote>

   

Commentary
----------

Dream reports very commonly include references to waking life embedded in them. These cases have the potential to be ambiguous, but mostly can be easily found and should not be included in any annotations.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">My teacher calls me. I say that I overslept and hang up</span> (that day / morning I really overslept and the conversation went similarly). <span class="nonlucid">I go back to sleep</span> in the dream and then wake up for real.</p>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">We were out, but I didn't know the club or the streets we walked through, which also seemed unknown to me</span> (when I think about it now).</p>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">He showed me his frozen feet and got excited about modern high alpinism</span> (I started reading a book from him yesterday!).</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>

If the comments and additions relate to the dream content (even if *referencing waking*), they should be included.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">I was driving a car that looked a lot like one I've seen in the Fast and the Furious. But it wasn't as fast and I lost the race :(</span> I figure I dreamed about that movie because I watched it a few nights ago.</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>



Multiple dreams
---------------

Each dream report should include **only 1 dream**. What constitutes multiple dreams is not very clear, so only include/highlight the first dream *as specified by the author*. That is, don't use any subjective judgement as to what constitues a new/second dream. Only cut this off if the author of the dream report specifies that – to them – a first dream ended and a second dream began.

Note that if there is a dream *other than the first dream* that stands out as the most vivid, you should use that dream *instead* of the first.


.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>Last night I had a few dreams. In the first dream, <span class="nonlucid">I was with a group of people who I'd never seen before. They tried to pressure me into playing baseball with them but I didn't want to.</span> The second dream was way more boring. I was shopping at the local store for things I needed to build a birdhouse. I might have had a third dream too, not sure.</p>

   <p>Dream 1: <span class="nonlucid">I was with a group of people who I'd never seen before. They tried to pressure me into playing baseball with them but I didn't want to.</span> Dream 2: The second dream was way more boring. I was shopping at the local store for things I needed to build a birdhouse. I might have had a third dream too, not sure. Dream 3: I was in an episode of Lost, not a main character.</p>

   <p>I had a few dreams. The first one I don't remember much, I think I was in an abandoned building looking for my dog. In the second dream, <span class="nonlucid">I was a member of a rock band. We had lots of shows and were in the middle of a tour across the globe.</span> I remember that <span class="nonlucid">we were about to finish our final show when the stage fell down.</span></p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>


Non-word sequences
------------------

Expressive non-word character sequences, like emojis, should be included. If the character sequence is otherwise arbitrary and not related to dream content, do not include.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>I just woke up. In my most recent dream <span class="nonlucid">I didn't stop running until I ran into a forest that had no trail. I couldn't figure out where to go so I just started wading through bushes in a random direction :/</span></p>

   <p>So much happened in my dream! <span class="nonlucid">I was walking on a mountain and then I started to get frightened.</span> ----------------------- <span class="nonlucid">I didn't care about the fear, and decided to continue on.</span></p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>



Incomplete content
------------------

Sometimes there are very short reports that have no real discernible content, only a vague statement of what happened. These should not be included/annotated.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>I had a memory only in the morning when I woke up, then forgot it.</p>
   <p>It was an entire night of chase dreams. Anxiety dreams.</p>
   <p>I had a precognitive dream. I dreamt of what I would experience the next day.</p>
   <p>Processing of the events experienced during the day. Woke up.</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>




Lucidity
--------

Lucid dreams are dreams where the dreamer becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming while remaining asleep (`Baird et al., 2019 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.03.008>`_). Simple enough right? Not really (`Mallett et al., 2021 <https://doi.org/10.33735/phimisci.2021.63>`_).

A lucid dream is not defined by vividness, nor by the amount of dream control. There is confusion here, perhaps because lucid dreams *tend to be* higher in vividness and dream control.

A lucid dream does not need to have dream awareness throughout the entire dream. Dream awareness, or *lucidity*, can wax and wane throughout a dream. If lucidity appears at all, the dream qualifies as a lucid dream.

But for annotating dreams, it is important to highlight lucid portions of a dream with a separate label/color. If a dream has lucid and non-lucid parts, only highlight the lucid parts as lucid dream content.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">I was in my old apartment. I was looking in the mirror and saw that I had long hair.</span> <span class="lucid">So I thought, I must be dreaming!</span> I probably had this realization because I actually but my hair in real life a few days ago.<span class="lucid"> I looked for the nearest window and stuck my head out to see how high up it was. It wasn't too far, so I tried to fly.</span></p>

   <p><span class="nonlucid">I was running from a bear in the woods, terrified.</span> <span class="lucid">But I became lucid and realized that I didn't need to run, since the bear wasn't even real! So I closed my eyes and re-opened them, and the bear was gone. I found myself at the edge of a cliff. I jumped off</span> then I woke up.</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>



In this case, you as the annotator are the judge of lucidity. That is, even if the author doesn't use the phrase "lucid", but they otherwise make it clear that they are aware of the dream, then it is lucid.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>I always have this nightmare. <span class="nonlucid">I am running away from an attacker, but I'm moving very slow and my legs won't work they way I want them to.</span> But in this instance, <span class="lucid">I recognized that I was dreaming and decided to wake up.</span> Then I did.</p>

   <p>I always have this nightmare. <span class="nonlucid">I am running away from an attacker, but I'm moving very slow and my legs won't work they way I want them to.</span> But in this instance, <span class="lucid">I thought "this isn't real" and decided to wake up.</span> Then I did. How great!</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>

Be conservative. If they imply knowing the experience was not real, but not that it was a dream specifically, keep it as non-lucid.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>I always have this nightmare. <span class="nonlucid">I am running away from an attacker, but I'm moving very slow and my legs won't work they way I want them to. I thought, "this isn't real", and decided to wake up.</span> Then I did.</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>


Lucidity is often fleeting. If the author states that lucidity might have dissipated, that should be included in the end of the lucid annotation.

.. raw:: html

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p>I finally had a lucid dream! <span class="nonlucid">At first I was walking along my old neighborhood street.</span> <span class="lucid">Then I became lucid and tried to find my friend, because we always said we would meet up in a lucid dream. But the lucidity quickly faded and I was in a non-lucid dream again.</span> <span class="nonlucid">I walked into the nearest house and asked for syrup.</span> What is that??</p>
   </em>
   </blockquote>


Lucidity falls along a continuum. It's possible to be "semi" or "partially" lucid, although what this exactly means is a bit ambiguous. It's not clear at the literature level, and surely used differently across people. For example, someone who frequently has "full-blown" lucid dreams that are stable and involve full dream control might call a brief moment of full dream awareness a "semi-lucid" dream, while someone's first moment of dream awareness, however fleeting, might also be a full lucid dream. It's also common to refer to moments of questioning the dream *without reaching lucidity* as "semi-lucid".

For our purposes, we are not including an annotation for partial lucidity. Thus, when lucidity is on the line, it is important to read the whole dream report and make your own evaluation as to whether the dreamer was aware of the dream at any given moment.

Be liberal with comments about being kinda lucid *after* having clear lucidity. Less so with dreams that only include partial lucidity.

   <blockquote class="dream">
   <em>
   <p><span class="lucid">I was lucid and trying to fly. It was getting strange and I feel like I started to lose lucidity. I kept trying to flap my wings but they wouldn't flap like I wanted them to.</span> Was that a lucid dream?</p>
   <p><span class="nonlucid">I think I was lucid and tried to fly. I soared over the mountains.</span> I never fully realized I was dreaming though.</p>
