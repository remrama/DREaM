**Dream reports should only relate to dream content.**

However, most dream reports contain some additional comments/add-ons that go beyond the dream content (i.e., *non-dream content*). These passages need to be deleted from the report.

In most cases, *non-dream content* appears at the beginning and end (3.2) of the report. But there are also passages like this within the report (3.3). In some cases, some reports even turn out to be devoid of dream content; these reports then have to be completely deleted (3.4). The modification of reports is not without problems, since the difference between whether the passage in question relates to the dream content is often not clear from the semantic content of the report. Therefore problematic examples are discussed in a further section (3.5).

*********
Beginning
*********

Introductory sentences such as "I dreamed ..." are deleted from the report. It is important to note that the position of the sentence may have to be changed.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p>Little memory. <span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Drove a car race in black and white in very, very old racing cars.</span></p>

    <p>I dream that <span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I am in a big city, I go to a lot of shops and lose...</span></p>

    <p>I can only remember that <span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I was standing in a place talking to people.</span></p>

    <p>Forward dream. <span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Already dreamed of what I could experience the next day.</span></p>
    </blockquote>

If the introductory sentence consists of a main clause and if dreaming is the verb in this main clause, the sentence cannot be changed.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I dreamed of a job at school, I totally failed!</span></p>

    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I dreamed of a ski tour with my father.</span></p>

    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Already dreamed of what I could experience the next day.</span></p>
    </blockquote>

End

Closing sentences such as "then I woke up" are deleted from the report. Please note that the position of the sentence may have to be changed.


.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">We decide on a film and drive off in the car.</span> Then I wake up.</p>

    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">But as long as I am still playing, I should please play in the attack, even though I played defense throughout the tournament.</span> I don't know any more.</p>

    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">The rock was bright red and the cave was, however, in the twilight.</span> Unfortunately, I can't remember anything more.</p>

    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I know my brother was very impatient and in a hurry while the three of us talked.</span> ~The dream or my memory ends when~ I wait[ed] waited alone in front of the room.</p>

    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Processing of the events experienced during the day.</span> Woke up.</p>
    </blockquote>

In some cases it is not possible to delete a passage even at the end of the dream report.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Like what?</span></p>
    </blockquote>

Comments and additions that do not belong to the dream content will be deleted from the report.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I say that I overslept and hang up</span> (that day / morning I really overslept and the conversation went similarly).</p>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Although I didn't know the disco and the streets we walked through also seemed unknown to me</span> (when I think about it now).</p>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">He showed me his frozen feet and got excited about modern high alpinism</span> (I started reading a book from him yesterday!).</p>
    </blockquote>

Comments and additions relating to the dream content must be retained in any case

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">Drove a car race in black and white in very, very old racing cars. It was actually quite nice. An adventure.</span></p>

Complete dream report
*********************

In the case of very short reports, it is possible that no dream content is reported at all. The complete report must be deleted there.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <em>
    <p>Have memories only in the morning when you wake up, then forget.</p>
    <p>The entire night of chase dreams. Anxiety dreams.</p>

Problematic reports

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color:lightyellow;">I had the feeling that the "bad guy" was looking at me and speaking to me.</span> All in all very exciting thing, I would like to know how it ended.</p>
    </blockquote>

The problem is “I would like to know how it ended”, as it is not clearly clear whether this is
